### Project Title
Can we accurately predict early-stage diabetes risk using patient demographic and life style choices and  medical, and symptom data?
**Author** : Mina Sardari

#### Executive summary
 


#### Rationale
Early detection of diabetes is crucial to preventing serious complications such as kidney failure, heart disease, and stroke.  This project aims to leverage machine learning to predict diabetes risk based on demographic, medical, and symptom data. By identifying high-risk individuals earlier, we can enable timely lifestyle changes or medical intervention, ultimately improving patient outcomes and reducing healthcare costs. Moreover, the use of data-driven models promotes equitable, scalable, and personalized care as this work highly relevant to todayâ€™s public health challenges.

#### Research Question
Can we accurately predict early-stage diabetes risk using patient demographic and life style choices and  medical, and symptom data?

#### Data Sources
What data will you use to answer you question?
Expected Data Sources(s):

Kaggle Diabetes Prediction Dataset
LinkLinks to an external site.
Includes demographic and biomedical measurements data.

This dataset contains 3 files:
diabetes _ 012 _ health _ indicators _ BRFSS2015.csv is a clean dataset of 253,680 survey responses to the CDC's BRFSS2015
diabetes _ binary _ 5050split _ health _ indicators _ BRFSS2015.csv is a clean dataset of 70,692 survey responses to the CDC's BRFSS2015
diabetes _ binary _ health _ indicators _ BRFSS2015.csv is a clean dataset of 253,680 survey responses to the CDC's BRFSS2015
#### Methodology
What methods are you using to answer the question?
Preprocessing & EDA
CRISP-DM, Data Preparation (cleaning missing values, encoding categorical features, scaling numerical attributes),
